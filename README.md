A laser cut enclosure for the Ultimaker 2

Credit where credit is due: While I drew this up by myself, it is basically a quick redesign of the enclosure made by Bertho Boman here: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/bertho-boman--2



This enclosure is meant to be cut out of 5/16" acrylic with a true thickness of .171". It was designed to fit an Ultimaker 2+. 

All files were designed in Freedom Units (IPS)

BOM: 
Acrylic or wood panels, roughly .171" thick. I would include an exact BOM, but everyone's laser cutter is a bit different, so arrange the design for yourself before you go buy stock so you can minimize waste. 

Glue for your material of choice


Instructions: 

Cut one of each file except sides, which you should cut 2. 

Use acrylic glue to glue them all together. THE ENCLOSURE BASE AND ENCLOSURE BOX BOTTOM MUST BE GLUED TOGETHER IN A PARTICULAR ORIENTATION, WITH THE CUTOUTS FOR THE BOWDEN TUBE MATCHED. Use the exploded diagram or the solidworks assembly as a guide. Glue up on a big box like this can be tricky, so make sure you use lots of clamps and check the squarenss of everything before it goes togehter. I suggest starting with the base, then the back and sides, then the top, then the front. Pay attention to which panel is on the "outside" when putting edges up against each other. 



Please be careful, acrylic is flamable and a malfunctioning 3d printer has the potential to burn your house down, so use at your own risk.
