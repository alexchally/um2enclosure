A laser cut enclosure for the Ultimaker 2


This enclosure is meant to be cut out of 5/16" acrylic with a true thickness of .171". It was designed to fit an Ultimaker 2+. 
All files were designed in Freedom Units (IPS)

Instructions: 

Cut one of each file except sides, which you should cut 2. 

Use acrylic glue to glue them all together. 




Please be careful, acrylic is flamable and a malfunctioning 3d printer has the potential to burn your house down, so use at your own risk.
